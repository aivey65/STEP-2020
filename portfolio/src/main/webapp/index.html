                <h1>My Current Personal Goals</h1>
                <p>I have a lot of goals for this summer, the summer of 2020. In a way, because I have so many,
                    it is a little unrealisic that I will accomplish them all. Still, I have hope. 
                </p>

                <h3>This Internship!</h3>
                <p>
                    I am looking forward to learning as much as I can during this time. It will be hard to get used 
                    to doing this work from home, but I want to make the most of things, no matter what. What I am most 
                    interested in is learning how to work with other people effectively. I am shy, but I feel like a 
                    people person. I like working with others, and I think solutions come out easier and better when there
                    are multiple people thinking about the problem and giving their perspective. That kind of collaboration 
                    is essential for good work in my opinion, and I think communication is a good skill to have in general. 
                    There are plenty of systems in place at Google that support this, and I look forward to learning about 
                    them.
                </p>

                <h3>Roller Skating</h3>
                <p>One of my goals this summer is learning how to roller skate. I used to love roller skating as 
                    a kid, though I haven't skated in a long time. More than 10 years probably. A couple months 
                    ago, however, I went roller skating at a roller rink with some friends. I had an amazing time, 
                    even though I wasn't there for very long. I forgot about it for a bit, but then, a couple weeks 
                    later, there was a scene in one of my favorite shows about roller skating. There was roller skating 
                    in the recent 'Birds of Prey' Harley Quinn movie, I started seeing people skating on social media. 
                    It was becomming a trend. I finally decided to do the inevitable and bought myself a pair of skates. 
                    I look forward to getting good at using them in my free time.

                </p>

                <h3>Japanese Language Learning</h3>
                <p> I took Japanese in highschool for 4 years. It is a great language, and I had a lot of fun learning it. 
                    I even got the opportunity to study abroad. Japanese culture is so interesting, 
                    and I enjoyed my time there. I have not been able to take Japanese classes in college due to all of 
                    the class requirments I have. Because I would still like to be fluent in Japanese, I want to take some sort 
                    of online class to help me brush up on what I learned in school. I also plan to take a Japanese class 
                    in the fall, which I am really excited about.
                </p>

                <h3>Digital Art</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to wanting to learn Japanese and how to roller skate, I would like to get into digital art. 
                    I like being able to express myself creatively, with drawing or writing. It is very calming for me. I 
                    am really excited to explore drawing digitally and seeing what I am capable of doing.
                </p>

                <h3>Mental Health</h3>
                <p>
                    I am in an on-going battle with myself. I am dissatisfied with myself, and try my best to get up and do 
                    the things that I want to, but I struggle to find the motivation to do even the simplest of things, whether 
                    that be getting out of bed, cooking dinner, organizing my room, or even talking with friends. I <i>am</i> really 
                    excited about my opportunity at Google though, and I look forward to taking this new motivation to 
                    improve my way of life.
